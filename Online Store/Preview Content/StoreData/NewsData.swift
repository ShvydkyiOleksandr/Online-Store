**What’s the secret?**

Most of the formulas for hair products on the market were created a long time ago and their action is not aimed at restoring hair, but at creating a cosmetic effect. A large number of silicones and just a little bit of really active components reduce the chances of hair to become healthy.

**When creating Dr. Sorbie products, the following ideas were taken as a basis:**

to prolong the vitality of hair, which directly affects their length, appearance and resistance to external influences (paint, hair dryer, sun, etc.) so that the hair after coloring can  be of a better quality than before;
the products should be easily combined with each other and perform not one, but many functions;
 to combine modern technology and the power of nature It is also worth mentioning that we are opposed to testing cosmetics on animals and the use of harmful chemical components.
We are chosen because our products are as natural and effective as possible.

Today more than ever, the Internet pages are full of frightening articles about the harm of silicones and parabens.  The owners of luxurious hair panic reading such articles and fall into a paranoid phobia by studying the labels of cosmetic products.

Let’s take a look at the silicones and create a better  understanding.  Silicones are a synthetic compound that is widely used in various industries such as electronics, textiles, cosmetics,  in various forms and modifications. In this article, we will give you a few tips that you must learn in order not to panic and not be afraid of silicones in the composition of certain products.

First, silicones are divided into two main groups: heavy  that have a cumulative effect, and light ones that do their job and are easily washed off from the hair.  There’s nothing wrong with a blockage when we need it. If the hair is badly damaged and there are deep cracks, then we just need treatments that will fill and hold in these cracks, and not be washed out with water.  For normal and healthy hair, this polymer will be less effective and vice versa can cause heaviness and a feeling of greasiness on the hair.

After reading about a particular component in the article or compounds encyclopedia, we may think that this component always works this way, but this is a wrong opinion and this is rule number two.  The same component can change its properties depending on the following factors: the level of the acidic environment: acidic or alkaline;the placement in the list of ingredients: at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end; and which active ingredients it interacts with. These three indicators will strongly influence its purpose, functions, and properties.  Thus, the same silicone can be an emulsifier, a polymer, a connecting component, a thermal protection, an amplifier of some softening components, a product base, and so on.

To sum up, we should not be afraid of silicones in product formulas, but we can not know exactly for what purpose and how much of this component is added to the product.  For comparison, you can give an example of adding formaldehyde to the composition: when the component is more than 2%, it acts as a rectifying and toxic component when heated; but when it is less than 1%, It works as a preservative and is often used in domestic glue, facial makeup, and even to create children’s toys.

- **Is it enough once a year?**
- **I use mask, why do I need something else?**
- **Can I buy this care  and do it myself at home?**

**These questions are often asked by  our clients.**

⠀Salon treatments offered by our company are not limited to one composition. Each client needs something individual. That is why we have created a whole group of products that in different combinations give the desired result.

Some hairs need proteins, others need lipids, and the third hair needs just a light nutritious care.

We have created three main salon care procedures that the master after our training can supplement at his discretion: VITA LAMINATION, SPA KERATIN, ANTI FRIZZ.

Vita lamination is a favorite care of all clients with any hair type. There is a table on which the master selects the recipe for formulations after hair diagnostics. After the procedure, the client feels a great result, as the hair becomes much healthier. However, it is important to note that the hair structure does not change. Our products only restore the broken bonds.  That is why such procedures should be systematic – like a visit to the dentist.

There are no substances that are tightly held in the hair for 12 months.

Our treatments have a cumulative effect that lasts for a long time with proper home care.

So how often do you need to have a salon care?

The frequency of care is chosen by the master, who, depending on the condition of the hair, can recommend a particular procedure.

Why  the client can’t simply buy a care set and do it at home?

You can buy everything… question WHETHER it is necessary?

- good salon care is not available either in stores or on websites, and is sold only by agents for masters; if this is not the case, you should think about how effective this care is.
- the cost of a care set is NOT small, and at different times you need to do DIFFERENT hair care.

The following questions immediately arise:

How much money should I spend on different sets?

Will you have time to use these treatments before the expiration date?

And how many procedures can you do in the salon spending the same money, but with a better effect?

There is also no need to say that without certain knowledge and experience, it is impossible to choose a suitable and working care that gives the maximum result.
