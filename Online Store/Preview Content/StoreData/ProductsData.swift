**KEY ACTIVE INGREDIENTS:**
• Hydrolyzed Keratin • Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein • Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein • Irish Red Algae Extract • Soy Protein • Vitamin B5 • Vitamin E • Coconut oil • Silk • Vitamin C.

**ACTION:**
The nourishing anti-aging shampoo TREATMENT from Dr. Sorbie is based on natural ingredients specifically for dry, chemically treated, aged and colored hair.

Due to its rich formula and acidic environment (PH=5) the TREATMENT shampoo gently cleanses the hair and the scalp, penetrates deep into the hair structure, saturating it with necessary microelements, and restores damaged areas of hair, acting on them from the inside. Anti-aging components deeply moisturize the skin and hair, smoothing the cuticle, forming a thin thermal protective film on its surface, which in turn retains the necessary level of moisture and nutrients inside the hair. A unique combination of natural ingredients, rich in vitamins, proteins and strong antioxidants, provides a prolonged regenerating effect and maximum color retention, neutralizing free radicals. Reliably protects hair from the negative effects of ultraviolet rays and prevents appearance of new split ends. The synergistic interaction of the bioactive components that make up the TREATMENT shampoo allows the pigment to remain inside the dyed hair and effectively prevents its early washing out.

Fills dyed hair with energy, makes it more durable, while maintaining softness and providing exquisite shine. Removes static electrification of the hair and prevents it from rapid becoming dirty. Does not weigh the hair down. Provides easy combing and styling.

With regular use of TREATMENT shampoo, the brightness, depth and saturation of the shade of the dyed hair lasts longer. Perfect for washing off and neutralizing any dyes, lightening products, prepares the hair for a uniform toning based on MOISTURE CONDITIONER. The effect is noticeable after the first use of the shampoo.
